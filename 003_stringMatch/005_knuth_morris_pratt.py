# The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is a string matching algorithm that can be used to efficiently search for a substring within a larger string. It's based on the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the substring and the larger string share a common prefix, so it's possible to skip over some of the characters in the larger string by making use of this information.

# In Python, the KMP algorithm can be implemented manually using the standard Python libraries. Here is an example of how you can implement the KMP algorithm in Python

# This will return Found substring at index 7 which is the index of the first letter of the substring "World" in the string "Hello, World!".

    m = len(substring)

    j = 0  # index for substring

    # Preprocess the substring
    computeLPSArray(substring, m, lps)

    i = 0  # index for string
    while i < n:
        if substring[j] == string[i]:

            j = lps[j-1]

        # mismatch after j matches
        elif i < n and substring[j] != string[i]:
            # Do not match lps[0..lps[j-1]] characters, they will match anyway
            if j != 0:
